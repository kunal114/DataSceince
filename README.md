<h1> RoadDataset-TimeSeriesPrediction </h1>

This Project aims in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset.

<h3> Aim </h3> 
To predcit 10th year Values from the given dataset for each Section.<br>
Applying extra-trees regressor model for each section by taking para 1-8 as input and para 9-13 as target and predicting on year 10 of each section

<h3>  Methodology Adopted </h3> 
1.Importing Dataset <br>
2.Preprocessing of Dataset<br>
3.Splitting of dataset into training set and test set by taking para 1-8 as input and para 9-13 as target and predicting on year 10 of each section<br>
4.Applying Extra Tree Regressor Model to train on training set and predicting values for test set<br>
